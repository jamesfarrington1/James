        <p>In "Media Archaeology: Method and Machine versus History and Narrative of Media" (2011)
            Wolfgang Ernst observes: 
            <br><br><p class="quote"><em>"If a radio from a museum collection is reactivated to play broadcast
            channels of the present, it changes its status: it is not a historical object anymore but actively
            generates sensual and informational presence."</em><br><br></p>
            <p><Similarly, when viewing old web pages in
            
            modern browsers we are confronted with a temporal paradox. Layer upon layer of 
            <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/cyberfest/index.htm">dated web-
                design aesthetics</a> overlap and peel like wallpaper, revealing earlier versions beneath. Pages
            
            optimised for lower resolutions now take <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/">less than a third of the screen</a>. 
            Ghosts of browsers past
            mingle with occasional page errors, dead links, and missing images. Sound files play
            automatically. Warnings abound, issued from earlier eras, addressed to readers who are not us. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col">
        <p>For example, M.D. Coverley’s 
            <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/frame5/coverley/index.html">The Personalization of Complexity</a>
            (2001) <br><br><em><p class="quote">"explores the ways in
            which each of our personal computers have become idiosyncratic, individualized entities, only
            sometimes manageable by the owners."</em><br><br></p> 
            <p>Fittingly, the piece itself warns that it is viewable only
            on Level 4 and 5 Microsoft Internet Explorer and Level 4 Netscape. Netscape 6 will not support
            many of the features in this essay.</p>
        <p>These are not artifacts of a dead web but rather, signposts on a map of a living web pointing to a
            web as it once was, a web in progress, a web in the making.</p>
        <h4>I evoke the term 'handmade web' in order to advocate for an ongoing active engagement
            with the making of web pages and of web policies.</h4>
