        <h1>A Handmade Web (Continued...)</h1>
    <p>I made my first web-based work in 1995. The impetus for <a href="https://luckysoap.com/butterflies/parasite.html">Fishes & Flying Things</a> came from the
        material practices of fine art and book-making. The text evolved from an installation art
        exhibition I had on at the time. From this text, I created a small book-work which was meant to
        tell a circular story but when people got to the end they stopped reading because that’s the way
        books work. In the web version, the last page linked to the first; the story circled round and
        round. Of the installation, no physical evidence remains. Of the book-work, only one copy. The
        QuarkExpress file is stored on a 44 MB SyQuest cartridge which I still own, but the contents of
        which I can no longer access. The handmade website, on the other hand, is still online and it still
        works.</p>
    <p>The handmade web emerged at a time when print and digital enjoyed a more symbiotic
        relationship. This is evident in the early output of the <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">trAce Online Writing Centre</a> founded at
        Nottingham Trent University in 1995. Over the next decade trAce evolved into one of the most
        influential online writing communities in the world. trAce’s first output was a 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/writersforthefuture/1995/">word-processed
        photocopied booklet</a> which contained links to websites distributing journals and zines. Fittingly,
        trAce’s last output was also a print booklet, in which it is stated:
        The trAce community embraced both camps, and some early chatlogs contain lively discussions
        about the use of mixed media in writing... The creative hypertexts and hypermedia in the trAce
        Archive can easily be compared to the multifarious pages of an artist’s book. (PDF 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/traces/traces.pdf">trAces: A
            Commemoration of Ten Years of Artistic Innovation at trAce</a>, page 14)
        One of the many interesting things about the 
        <a href="http://tracearchive.ntu.ac.uk/index.asp">online archive</a> of the trAce Online Writing Centre is
        how much it reflects the context of the creation and dissemination of its contents. Whereas
        archives held in museums or libraries generally contain artifacts created elsewhere —
        manuscripts illuminated in a monastery, for example, or photographs developed in a darkroom
        — the handmade web pages contained in this online archive continue to exist in the medium
        within which they were created. That said, the frames through which we view them continue to
        change.</p>
