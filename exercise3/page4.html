            (2012), Anil Dash writes: <br><br><em>"In the early days of the social web, there was a
            broad expectation that regular people might own their own identities by having their own
            websites, instead of being dependent on a few big sites to host their online identity."</em><br></p>
        <p>In February 2015 the online journal QUARTZ published an article with the provocative
            headline: 
            <a href="https://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet">Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet</a>. As the article
            states: <br><br><em><p class="quote">"This is more than a matter of semantics. The expectations and behaviors of the next
            billion people to come online will have profound effects on how the internet evolves."</em><br></p>
        <p>In October 2014 the online journal GIZMODO published an article heralding 
           <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-great-web-1-0-revival-1651487835">The Great Web 1.0
            Revival</a> 
            . Its author Kyle Chayka observed:
            The booming size of today's mainstream social networks and the constant level of noise we
            have to deal with has inspired a sudden return to a time when the internet was quieter, safer,
            and more intimate... We're nostalgic for the close-knit, DIY nature of the early web, where
            everything was smaller...
            The DIY aesthetics and practices of the mid-1990s have been embraced by the anti-social
            network 
           <a href="https://tilde.club">TILDE.CLUB</a> 
            , which hosts a small community of users on a single unix computer. For
            some, TILDE.CLUB serves as a platform for revisiting amateur web aesthetics in a
            contemporary context. For example, on her page, Olia Lialina invites users to view a new net art
            work <a href="https://tilde.club/~olialia/">640x480</a>
             - a 4-tab browser installation. For many others however, TILDE.CLUB has served
            as little more than a hip territory to occupy. Many pages remain blank.</p>
